#Hints

## **Simple Baseline**
* Run sample code

## **Medium Baseline**
* Feature selection: 40 states + 2 `tested_positive` (`TODO` in dataset)

## **Strong Baseline**
* Feature selection (what other features are useful?)
* DNN architecture (layers? dimension? activation function?)
* Training (mini-batch? optimizer? learning rate?)
* L2 regularization
* There are some mistakes in the sample code, can you find them?
