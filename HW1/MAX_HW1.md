# Hints

## Simple Baseline 

Run sample code

## Medium Baseline 
  Feature selection: 40 states + 2 `tested_positive` (`TODO` in dataset)

## Strong Baseline 
1. Feature selection (what other features are useful?)
2. DNN architecture (layers? dimension? activation function?)
3. Training (mini-batch? optimizer? learning rate?)
4. L2 regularization
5. There are some mistakes in the sample code, can you find them?
